This license agreement ("License"), effective today, is made by and between you ("Licensee") and IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, an Italian foundation having its statewide administrative offices at Viale dei Cappuccini 1, 71013, San Giovanni Rotondo (FG), Italy ("CSS"), and concerns certain software known as "FastqWiper," an ensamble method to recover corrupted FASTQ files, drop or fix pesky lines, remove unpaired reads, and fix reads interleaving, developed by the Bioinformatics unit at CSS for research purposes and includes Snakemake workflows and third-party software whose redistribution is allowed ("Software").

General. A non-exclusive, nontransferable, perpetual license is granted to the Licensee to use the Software and its downloadable parts for academic, non-profit, or government-sponsored research purposes. Use of the Software under this License is restricted to non-commercial purposes. Commercial use of the Software requires a separately executed license agreement to be requested by email to: bioinformatics@css-mendel.it.
Permitted Use and Restrictions. Licensee agrees that it will use the Software, and any modifications, improvements, or derivatives to the Software that the Licensee may create (collectively, "Improvements") solely for internal, non-commercial purposes and shall not distribute or transfer the Software or Improvements to any person or third parties without prior written permission from CSS. The term "non-commercial," as used in this License, means academic or other scholarly research which (a) is not undertaken for profit, or (b) is not intended to produce works, services, or data for commercial use, or (c) is neither conducted, nor funded, by a person or an entity engaged in the commercial use, application or exploitation of works similar to the Software.
Ownership and Assignment of Copyright. The Licensee acknowledges that CSS holds copyright in the Software. The Licensee agrees that any Improvements made by Licensee shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as the Software. Licensee agrees not to assert a claim of infringement in Licensee copyrights in Improvements in the event CSS prepares substantially similar modifications or derivative works. The Licensee agrees to use his/her reasonable best efforts to protect the contents of the Software and to prevent unauthorized disclosure by its agents, officers, employees, and consultants. If the Licensee receives a request to furnish all or any portion of the Software to a third party, Licensee will not fulfill such a request but will refer the third party to the CSS's Bioinformatics unit web page so that the third party's use of this Software will be subject to the terms and conditions of this License. Notwithstanding the above, Licensee may disclose any Improvements that do not involve disclosure of the Software.
Copies. The Licensee may make a reasonable number of copies of the Software for the purposes of backup, maintenance of the Software or the development of derivative works based on the Software.

To the extent permitted by law, Licensee shall indemnify, defend with counsel acceptable to CSS, and hold harmless CSS and the developers of the Software, their successors, agents, officers, and employees against any and all claims, liability, cost, damage, deficiency, loss, or obligation, of any kind or nature (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and other costs and expenses of defense), including without limitation any cause of action relating to product liability, any incidental or consequential damage either direct or indirect, whether incurred, made or suffered by Licensee or any third party obtaining access to the Software through Licensee, in connection with and to the extent arising out of, the Licensee's furnishing, performance, possession or use of the Software or in connection with the Licensee's exercise of its rights under this License. This provision shall survive termination of this License.
Termination. This License is effective until terminated by either party. Licensee's rights under this License will terminate automatically without notice from CSS if Licensee fails to comply with any term(s) of this License. Licensee may terminate the License by giving written notice of termination to CSS. Upon termination of this License, Licensee shall immediately discontinue all use of the Software and destroy the original and all copies, full or partial, of the Software, including any modifications or derivative works, and associated documentation.
